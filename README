This is the colorscheme I've come up with "over the years".  It assumes for console that
you have the term set for a black background and gray text.  If you switch to a lighter
scheme, it may not be very visible. 

It works pretty well on transparent term windows, better if you can partially shade them.

Sorry it doesn't have a flashy name, but it doesn't seem to have any theme to it.
